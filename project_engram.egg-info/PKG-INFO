## Project Engram (pmem)
A zero-dependency, drop-in persistent memory layer for CLI Coding Agents.

## The Problem
CLI Agents are stateless. They don't remember architectural decisions made yesterday, leading to inconsistent code styles and repeated mistakes.

## The Solution
Engram acts as a "hive mind" for your agents. It creates a .engram/ directory where it stores semantic memories in Markdown, and provides a CLI tool (pmem) that agents are instructed to use.

## Installation
pip install -e .

## Quick Start
Initialize:

pmem init

This creates .engram/ and AGENT_PROTOCOLS.md.

Instruct the Agent: Add this to your prompt when starting an agent:

"Read AGENT_PROTOCOLS.md and follow the instructions before starting."

Search by tag:

pmem tags
pmem recall --tag decisions

## Features
- Atomic Locking: Safe for multiple concurrent agents.

- Recency Bias: Newer memories rank higher in search results.

- Deprecation: Agents can mark old decisions as obsolete.

- Critical Constraints: Flag memories as --critical to force them to appear in every search (good for safety rules).

- Tag Search: Filter recall results by tag via `pmem recall --tag <tag>`.
